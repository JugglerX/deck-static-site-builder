                "description": "Hello Berlin-visitors! \nI am renting a cozy room in a shared two-bedroom apartment.\n\nThe room: about 24 sqm, with a 1,4m x 2m bed (about US-queen-size, big enough for a couple), and a desk. \nThe flat: fully equipped kitchen, washing machine, a bath with bathtub, and wi-fi. \n\nThe area: The flat is in Mitte, close to the “Rosenthaler Vorstadt”, where you will find all you need: two grocery stores, several cafes and restaurants (both cheap and very high end). It is an ideal place to start your sightseeing tour, since you are in walking distance (about 10-15 min) from the government district, Brandenburger Tor, Tiergarten, Unter den Linden, Alexanderplatz, Museumsinsel, Friedrichstraße, Mauer-Museum etc.\n\nFor going out, you are very close to Torstraße/Oranienburger Str., Prenzlauer Berg and Rosenthaler Platz (about 10 min), and you can be in Kreuzberg or Neukölln in about 15-20 min by subway. The U6 station “Naturkundemuseum” and Nordbahnhof (S1, S2, s25) are just around the corner, and two stops from Friedrichstraße, which is a big subway hub.\n\nYou can contact me in German, English, Spanish, French (and Italian if you are patient with me).",
